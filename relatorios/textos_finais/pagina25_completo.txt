Serbian Youth Activist Targeted by Android 0-Day Exploit Chain— A 23-year-old Serbian youth activist had their Android phonetargetedby a zero-day exploit chain developed by Cellebrite to unlock the device and likely deploy an Android spyware called NoviSpy. The flaws combined CVE-2024-53104 with CVE-2024-53197 and CVE-2024-50302 to escalate privileges and achieve code execution. The vulnerabilities, originally present within the Linux kernel, were addressed in December 2024. CVE-2024-53104 has since been addressed in Android as of early February 2025. In response to the development, Cellebrite said it will no longer allow Serbia to use its software, stating "we found it appropriate to stop the use of our products by the relevant customers at this time."
