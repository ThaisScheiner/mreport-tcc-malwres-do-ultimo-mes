5 Active Malware Campaigns in Q1 2025

CORPO DA NOTÍCIA:
The first quarter of 2025 has been a battlefield in the world of cybersecurity. Cybercriminals continued launching aggressive new campaigns and refining their attack methods.
Below is an overview of five notable malware families, accompanied by analyses conducted in controlled environments.
In early 2025, threat actors began exploiting a technique known as ClickFix to distribute the NetSupport Remote Access Trojan (RAT).
This method involves injecting fake CAPTCHA pages into compromised websites, prompting users to execute malicious PowerShell commands that download and run the NetSupport RAT.
Once installed, this RAT grants attackers full control over the victim's system, allowing activities such as real-time screen monitoring, file manipulation, and execution of arbitrary commands.
After running the NetSupport RAT payload insideANY.RUN's Interactive Sandbox, we can see several activities.

When NetSupport RAT infects a system, it immediately establishes a connection with a command-and-control (C2) server, allowing attackers to operate the compromised machine remotely.
Through this connection, attackers can execute system commands, deploy additional malware, and modify system settings.

NetSupport RAT employs multiple Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to maintain persistence, evade detection, and gather system data. Key TTPs include:
These techniques demonstrate how NetSupport RAT establishes control while avoiding detection, all of which are visible in ANY.RUN's ATT&CK mapping.
The Lynx Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) group is known as a highly organized entity, offering a structured affiliate program and robust encryption methods. Building upon the foundation of the earlier INC ransomware, Lynx has enhanced its capabilities and expanded its reach, targeting a diverse range of industries across multiple countries.
Lynx's affiliate panel allows its affiliates to configure victim profiles, generate custom ransomware samples, and manage data-leak schedules within a user-friendly interface. Because of its structured approach, it becomes one of the most accessible ransomware even for those with limited technical expertise.
To incentivize participation, Lynx offers affiliates an 80% share of ransom proceeds. The group maintains a leak site where stolen data is published if victims fail to pay the ransom.
In the first quarter of 2025, the Lynx Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) group has intensified its operations, targeting various industries with sophisticated attacks.
Particularly, in February 2025, Lynx claimed responsibility for breaching Brown and Hurley, a prominent Australian truck dealership. The group alleged the theft of approximately 170 gigabytes of sensitive data, including human resources documents, business contracts, customer information, and financial records.
In January 2025, Lynx also breached Hunter Taubman Fischer & Li LLC, a U.S.-based law firm specializing in corporate and securities law.
We can observe Lynx Ransomware's behavior firsthand in a controlled environment. In the ANY.RUN sandbox analysis, after executing the Lynx payload, the infected system undergoes several noticeable changes.

The desktop background is replaced with a ransom message, and the attackers leave a note warning that all data has been stolen and encrypted. Victims are instructed to download Tor to contact them.
The sandbox also detects how Lynx systematically renames files, appending its extension. For example, C:\Users\admin\Desktop\academicroad.rtf becomes C:\Users\admin\Desktop\academicroad.rtf.LYNX.
Dozens of files across the system are modified this way, further confirming its encryption process. These are just a few of the many destructive actions Lynx carries out once inside a compromised system.
In early 2025, cybersecurity researchers uncovered a sophisticated malware campaign deploying AsyncRAT, a remote access trojan known for its efficient, asynchronous communication capabilities.
This campaign stands out due to its use of Python-based payloads and the exploitation of TryCloudflare tunnels to enhance stealth and persistence.
The attack initiates with a phishing email containing a Dropbox URL. When recipients click the link, they download a ZIP archive housing an internet shortcut (URL) file.
This file, in turn, retrieves a Windows shortcut (LNK) file via a TryCloudflare URL. Executing the LNK file triggers a series of scripts, PowerShell, JavaScript, and batch scripts, that download and execute a Python payload.
This payload is responsible for deploying multiple malware families, including AsyncRAT, Venom RAT, and XWorm.
Inside ANY.RUN's analysis session, we can open the MalConf section to reveal the malicious configurations used by AsyncRAT.

As we can see, AsyncRAT connects to masterpoldo02[.]kozow[.]com over port 7575, allowing remote attackers to control infected machines. Blocking this domain and monitoring traffic to this port can help prevent infections.
Besides, AsyncRAT installs itself in %AppData% to blend in with legitimate applications and uses a mutex (AsyncMutex_alosh) to prevent multiple instances from running.
The malware also uses AES encryption with a hardcoded key and salt, making it difficult for security tools to analyze its communications.
In early 2025, cybersecurity experts uncovered a sophisticated campaign involving Lumma Stealer, an information-stealing malware.
Attackers used GitHub's release infrastructure to distribute this malware, exploiting the platform's trustworthiness to bypass security measures.
Once executed, Lumma Stealer initiates additional malicious activities, including downloading and running other threats like SectopRAT, Vidar, Cobeacon, and additional Lumma Stealer variants.

A detailed examination using the ANY.RUN sandbox demonstrates Lumma Stealer's behavior.
Upon execution, the malware connects to its command-and-control server, facilitating the exfiltration of sensitive data. The analysis also reveals the triggering of specific Suricata rules:
The analysis session also reveals how Lumma steals credentials from web browsers and exfiltrates personal data:
In a wave of social engineering attacks, cybercriminals have been leveraging InvisibleFerret, a stealthy Python-based malware, to compromise unsuspecting victims.
Disguised as legitimate software in fake job interview processes, this malware has been actively used in the fake interview campaign, where attackers pose as recruiters to trick professionals into downloading malicious tools.
A key element of the InvisibleFerret attack is the deployment of BeaverTail, a malicious NPM module that delivers a portable Python environment (p.zip) to execute the malware.
Acting as the first stage in a multi-layered attack chain, BeaverTail sets up InvisibleFerret, a stealthy backdoor with advanced obfuscation and persistence mechanisms, making detection difficult.
By submitting InvisibleFerret to ANY.RUN's Interactive Sandbox, we can analyze its behavior in real time:

The malware starts by collecting system information, such as OS version, hostname, username, and geolocation, using services like ip-api.com, a method also used by cryptocurrency drainers.
Malicious requests blend with normal traffic, making detection challenging. ANY.RUN's interface highlights these activities, showing network requests in orange and red beneath the virtual machine.
Clicking on the ATT&CK button in ANY.RUN's sandbox provides a breakdown of InvisibleFerret's TTPs. One key detection is T1016 ("System Network Configuration Discovery"), which highlights how the malware gathers geolocation and system data.
The first quarter of 2025 has been filled with stealthy and aggressive cyber threats, from ransomware operations to silent data stealers. But attackers don't have to win.
