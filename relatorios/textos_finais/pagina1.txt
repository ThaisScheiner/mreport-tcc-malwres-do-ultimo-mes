CORPO DA NOTÍCIA:
What if attackers aren't breaking in—they're already inside, watching, and adapting?
This week showed a sharp rise in stealth tactics built for long-term access and silent control. AI is being used to shape opinions. Malware is hiding inside software we trust. And old threats are returning under new names. The real danger isn't just the breach—it's not knowing who's still lurking in your systems. If your defenses can't adapt quickly, you're already at risk.
Here are the key cyber events you need to pay attention to this week.
Lemon Sandstorm Targets Middle East Critical Infra— The Iranian state-sponsored threat group tracked as Lemon Sandstormtargetedan unnamed critical national infrastructure (CNI) in the Middle East and maintained long-term access that lasted for nearly two years using custom backdoors like HanifNet, HXLibrary, and NeoExpressRAT. The activity, which lasted from at least May 2023 to February 2025, entailed "extensive espionage operations and suspected network prepositioning – a tactic often used to maintain persistent access for future strategic advantage," according to Fortinet.
Active Directory misconfigurations give attackers the perfect entry point to escalate privileges and move laterally. One weak link is all it takes. Use this AD Security Checklist to identify and fix critical gaps before they're exploited, Download now and secure your Active Directory.
Attackers love software vulnerabilities—they're easy doors into your systems. Every week brings fresh flaws, and waiting too long to patch can turn a minor oversight into a major breach. Below are this week's critical vulnerabilities you need to know about. Take a look, update your software promptly, and keep attackers locked out.
This week's list includes —CVE-2025-3928(Commvault Web Server),CVE-2025-1976(Broadcom Brocade Fabric OS),CVE-2025-46271, CVE-2025-46272, CVE-2025-46273, CVE-2025-46274, CVE-2025-46275(Planet Technology),CVE-2025-23016(FastCGI),CVE-2025-43864(React Router),CVE-2025-21756(Linux Kernel),CVE-2025-31650(Apache Tomcat),CVE-2025-46762(Apache Parquet),CVE-2025-2783(Google Chrome),CVE-2025-23242, CVE-2025-23243(NVIDIA Riva),CVE-2025-23254(NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM),CVE-2025-3500(Avast Free Antivirus),CVE-2025-32354(Zimbra Collaboration Server),CVE-2025-4095(Docker),CVE-2025-30194(PowerDNS),CVE-2025-32817(SonicWall Connect Tunnel Windows Client),CVE-2025-29953(Apache ActiveMQ),CVE-2025-4148,CVE-2025-4149,CVE-2025-4150(NETGEAR),CVE-2025-2082(Tesla Model 3),CVE-2025-3927(Digigram PYKO-OUT),CVE-2025-24522, CVE-2025-32011, CVE-2025-35996, CVE-2025-36558(KUNBUS Revolution Pi),CVE-2025-35975, CVE-2025-36521(MicroDicom DICOM Viewer),CVE-2025-2774(Webmin),CVE-2025-29471(Nagios), andCVE-2025-32434(PyTorch).
Sandbox Your AI Agent — File Access Is the Silent Threat— Most AI agents don't need access to your system files — but they often have it by default. That means if an attacker tricks your agent (via prompt injection, plugin abuse, or tool misuse), it could accidentally expose things like SSH keys, cloud credentials, or logs. This is one of the easiest ways for attackers to move deeper into your environment — and it often goes unnoticed.
Even if you've locked down API access or IAM roles, the local file system is still a weak spot. Your agent might be able to read .ssh/authorized_keys, .aws/credentials, or even environment files with secrets — just by asking the right question. And once that data is exposed, it's game over.
You can fix this fast with sandboxing. Use tools like Firejail (Linux) to block access to sensitive folders. This blocks the agent from seeing key files, locks down temp folders, and adds guardrails — even if something inside the agent misbehaves.
Running your AI agent in a sandbox takes minutes, but massively reduces your attack surface. It's a small move that closes a big gap — and it works even if everything else looks secure.
Every alert this week reinforces a simple truth: cybersecurity isn't just about defense—it's about detection, speed, and accountability. As threats grow quieter and more calculated, the margin for delay shrinks. Don't just monitor. Measure. Map. Respond. Then ask yourself—where else could they be?
AI boosts speed and scale—but also risk. Hidden identity accounts can expose your systems if left unsecured.
